      <h3>Initial plan for project</h3>
      <p>
        My plan for this project was to use a dataset of old artists with their
        art. Then i would allow the user to pick 3 artworks, that were displayed
        in the gui, from an artist or genre or timeperiod. Then a new artwork
        would be generated from these artworks. This was suggested by my project
        leader but they didn't take into account that AI needs to be trained so
        I had to decide on a new plan. I decided to focus on just Van Gogh and
        generate art from his artworks with no prompting or input from the user,
        as this was more realistic. I initially chose html for my gui as this
        seemed ideal if a museum were to use this tool, they may opt to run it
        online. I chose to implement DDPM and DCGAN as these seemed to be
        effective models for image generation. I was limited to just my computer
        which had a 6700XT AMD GPU.

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The first problem I faced was that I couldn't use my GPU for training
        whilst on Windows as AMD requires ROCM to use the GPU which is only
        available on Linux. I decided to dual boot Linux and Windows. Having
        never used Linux before, this led to a number of issues such as my GPU
        not being recognised by Python. The solution to this was to run some
        commands in the terminal to help identify the GPU I wanted to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        I initially used a basic GAN to get used to using PyTorch, whilst this
        was helpful, the results were poor. Next i implemented DCGAN which has
        convolutional layers which are better with images. I however couldn't
        improve the size of the image past 64x64 because of my small VRAM size.
        The results seemed to show some learning but the quality was simply too
        bad. The dataset for Van Gogh artworks was 877 artworks, which for
        training AI is quite small, especially without good hardware. I
        implemented various data augmentation techniques but this didn't help
        the results. This led to me having to research alternative solutions. I
        decided to try CycleGAN which trained two datasets against each other. I
        used a landscape dataset of 2676 images. The results were much better
        and much higher quality, there were clear resemblances with Van Gogh's
        artworks. DDPM was the last model I implemented and I knew that this
        model would me the most limited by my hardware. I could only use 64x64
        and after many nights of training, the results didn't resemble anything,
        they were mostly just noise. I decided to instead use a pretrained Van
        Gogh diffusion model from HuggingFace. This could use prompts to
        generate anything in a Van Gogh style.
